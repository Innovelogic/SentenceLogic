Write the boolean expression for the logic network that have a 1 output when X=1,Y=0,Z=0;X=1,Y=1,Z=0; and" X=1,Y=1,Z=1. The circuit will have a 0 output for all other sets of input values. Simplify the expression derived and draw a block diagram for the simplified expression.
Q.Derive the Boolean expression for a gating network that will have an output of 0 only when X=1, Y=1, Z=1; X=0, Y=0, Z=0; X=1, Y=0, Z=0. The outputs are to be 1 for all other cases.
Q.If there is a logic network which is having three inputs A,B and C where the result will be one only when A=1, B=0, C=1; A=1,B=1,C=0 or A=1,B=1,C=1. Develop a Boolean expression to given conditions.
Q.There is a logic network which has three inputs (A, B  and C) and two outputs (X and Y). The output value of X will be 1 when the combination of A, B, and C leads to an even number. The output value of Y will be 1 only when the combination of A, B, and C leads to an odd number. Derive the Boolean Expression related to above conditions.
Q.There is a logic network which has two inputs (K and M) and two outputs (X and Y). The output value of X will be 1 when the combination of K and M leads to zero. The output value of Y will be 1 only when the combination of K and M leads to an even number. Derive the Boolean Expression related to the above condition.
Q.Design a Boolean Expression for a Logic network which has 3 inputs A, B, and C where the output of this network will be 1 when the combination of A,B, and C has more 1s compared to 0s.
Q.Write the boolean expression for a logic circuit system which has two inputs where the output value will be 1 only when the inputs are having the same value
Q.There exists a logic circuit network which contains three inputs where the final outcome will be 1 when the combination of those inputs having more 0s compared to 1s.
